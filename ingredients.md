# Ingredients for Pasta
1. **You can add your choice of veggies in the pasta**. Usually, the veggies which I add are carrots, capsicum, french beans, green peas (matar), cauliflower or cabbage.
2. However this recipe can also be made without any veggies. But I would suggest adding the veggies as it makes the dish more wholesome and nutritious. Few more pasta recipes where you can add mix vegetables to make the dish more healthy are [**One pot pasta**](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/one-pot-pasta-recipe/), [**Pasta alfredo**](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/pasta-in-alfredo-sauce-recipe/) and [**White sauce pasta**](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/white-sauce-pasta-recipe/).
3. I have used whole wheat penne pasta. You can also use macaroni or other pasta varieties.
